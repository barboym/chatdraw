Your task is to specify where to place strokes on the grid to create a visually appealing sketch of the given textual concept.\\nThe grid uses numbers (1 to 50) along the bottom (x axis) and numbers (1 to 50) along the left edge (y axis) to reference specific locations within the grid. Each cell is uniquely identified by a combination of the corresponding x axis numbers and y axis number (e.g., the bottom-left cell is 'x1y1', the cell to its right is 'x2y1').\\nYou can draw on this grid by specifying where to draw strokes. You can draw multiple strokes to depict the whole object, where different strokes compose different parts of the object. \\nTo draw a stroke on the grid, you need to specify the following:\\nStarting Point: Specify the starting point by giving the grid location (e.g., 'x1y1' for column 1, row 1).\\nEnding Point: Specify the ending point in the same way (e.g., 'x50y50' for column 50, row 50).\\nIntermediate Points: Specify at least two intermediate points that the stroke should pass through. List these in the order the stroke should follow, using the same grid location format (e.g., 'x6y5', 'x13y10' for points at column 6 row 5 and column 13 row 10).\\nParameter Values (t): For each point (including the start and end points), specify a t value between 0 and 1 that defines the position along the stroke's path. t=0 for the starting point. t=1 for the ending point.\\nIntermediate points should have t values between 0 and 1 (e.g., \\\"0.3 for x6y5, 0.7 for x13y10\\\").\\nExamples:\\nTo draw a smooth curve that starts at x8y6, passes through x6y7 and x6y10, ending at x8y11:\\nPoints = ['x8y6', 'x6y7', 'x6y10', 'x8y11']\\nt_values = [0.00,0.30,0.80,1.00]\\nTo close this curve into an ellipse shape, you can add another curve:\\nPoints = ['x8y11', 'x11y10', 'x11y7', 'x8y6']\\nt_values = [0.00,0.30,0.70,1.00]\\nTo draw a large circle that starts at x25y44 and ends at x25y44, passing through the cells x32y41, x35y35, x31y29, x25y27, x19y29, x15y35, x18y41:\\nPoints = ['x25y44', 'x32y41', 'x35y35', 'x31y29', 'x25y27', 'x19y29', 'x15y35', 'x18y41', 'x25y44']\\nt_values = [0.00, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.50, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, 1.00]\\nTo draw non-smooth shapes (with corners) like triangles or rectangles, you need to specify the corner points twice with adjacent corresponding t values.\\nFor example, to draw an upside-down \\\"V\\\" shape that starts at x13y27, ends at x24y27, with a pick (corner) at x18y37:\\nPoints = ['x13y27', 'x18y37','x18y37', 'x24y27']\\nt_values = [0.00,0.55,0.5,1.00]\\nTo draw a triangle with corners at x10y29, x15y33, and x9y35, start with drawing a \\\"V\\\" shape that starts at x10y29, ends at x9y35, with a pick (corner) at x15y33:\\nPoints = ['x10y29', 'x15y33', 'x15y33', 'x9y35']\\nt_values = [0.00,0.55,0.5,1.00]\\nand then close it with a straight line from x13y27 to x24y27 to form a triangle:\\nPoints = ['x13y27', 'x24y27']\\nt_values = [0.00,1.00]\\nNote that for a triangle, the start and end points should be different from each other.\\nTo draw a rectangle with four corners at x13y27, x24y27, x24y11, x13y11:\\nPoints = ['x13y27', 'x24y27', 'x24y27', 'x24y11', 'x24y11', 'x13y11', 'x13y11', 'x13y27']\\nt_values = [0.00,0.3,0.25,0.5,0.5,0.75,0.75,1.00]\\nTo draw a small square with four corners at x26y25, x29y25, x29y21, x26y21:\\nPoints = ['x26y25', 'x29y25', 'x29y25', 'x29y21', 'x29y21', 'x26y21', 'x26y21', 'x26y25']\\nt_values = [0.00,0.3,0.25,0.5,0.5,0.75,0.75,1.00]\\nTo draw a single dot at x15y31 use:\\nPoints = ['x15y31']\\nt_values = [0.00]\\nTo draw a straight linear line that starts at x18y31 and ends at x35y14 use:\\nPoints = ['x18y31', 'x35y14']\\nt_values = [0.00, 1.00]\\nIf you want to draw a big and long stroke, split it into multiple small curves that connect to each other.\\nThese instructions will define a smooth stroke that follows a Bezier curve from the starting point to the ending point, passing through the specified intermediate points.\\nTo draw a visually appealing sketch of the given object or concept, break down complex drawings into manageable steps. Begin with the most important part of the object, then observe your progress and add additional elements as needed. Continuously refine your sketch by starting with a basic structure and gradually adding complexity. Think step-by-step.\"\n",

Add the stem\\n4. Add a leaf\\n5. Add any additional details if needed\\n\\nNow, let me think about the placement on the grid:\\n- The apple should be centered, so I'll place it roughly in the middle of the 50x50 grid\\n- The main body should take up a good portion of the grid, but not be too large or too small\\n- I'll position it slightly higher than center to leave room for the stem and leaf\\n\\nLet me define the specific coordinates for each part:\\n\\n1. Main apple body:\\n   - I'll create this with a nearly circular shape, slightly wider than tall\\n   - Center around x25y25, with a width of about 20 units and height of about 18 units\\n   - So the apple will span roughly from x15 to x35 horizontally and y16 to y34 vertically\\n\\n2. Indentation at the top:\\n   - Small curve at the top center of the apple, around x25y34\\n\\n3. Stem:\\n   - Starting from the indentation, going upward\\n   - From around x25y34 to x23y40\\n\\n4.

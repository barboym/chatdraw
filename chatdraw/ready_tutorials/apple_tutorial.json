        "instruction": "Draw a light circle for the general shape of the apple. Add a slight dip at the top for the stem area. Sketch a vertical and horizontal guideline to help with symmetry.",
        "tip": "Hold your pencil loosely and use your whole arm, not just your wrist, to create smooth curves."

        "title": "Refine the Shape and Add the Stem",
        "instruction": "Refine the apple's contour by softening the sides and adding subtle bulges to make it more natural. Draw the small dip at the top and sketch in the stem.",
        "tip": "The stem doesn't need to be centered - apples in nature have stems that are often off to one side."

        "step": 3, 
        "title": "Add the Dip and Bottom",
        "instruction": "Add a small dip at the top where the stem connects. Then, add a subtle dip at the bottom of the apple.",
        "tip": "Look at real apples for reference - they have characteristic indentations at both the top and bottom."

        "step": 4,
        "title": "Add Dimension",
        "instruction": "Darken the outline of your apple. Then add a curved line to represent the side of the apple, giving it a 3D appearance.",
        "tip": "Imagine a light source coming from one direction and think about which parts of the apple would catch the light."

        "step": 5,
        "title": "Add Basic Shading",
        "instruction": "Add some light shading to give your apple volume. Shade one side darker than the other to create a sense of depth.",
        "tip": "Use the side of your pencil and build up the shading gradually with light pressure."

        "title": "Add Final Details",
        "instruction": "Add some light texture or spots to make your apple look more realistic. You can also darken some areas for contrast.",
        "tip": "Real apples often have small spots or variations in color - adding these subtle details makes your drawing more lifelike."

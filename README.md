This projects objective is to create a chatboy that teaches you to draw simple sketches in mspaint-like apps (where I invision using the edit feature in whatsapp in practice) 

TODO (high level): 
- sketch tutorial generator - most of it is available from reasearch 
 - generate a sketch with steps (done) 
 - format the sketch strokes as a tutorial (list of steps where each steps has some instructions and examples) 
- cli for doing each step (create the interaction where the chat can recieve an image/text and respond to it). 
- gui (either do a whatsapp bot)
